## Exercise 1: Declaring Variables

1. Declare a variable named firstName using the `const` keyword, and assign your name as the string value
2. Declare a variable named lastName using the `let` keyword, and assign your name as the string value
3. Declare a variable named age using the `var` keyword, and assign your age as the number value

## Exercise 2: Working with Strings

1. Declare a variable named fullName using the `let` keyword, and assign your `firstName` plus your `lastName` as the string value
2. Print the value of `fullName` to the console (to open you browser console in Google Chrome, right-click and press "Inspect" or fn+F12)
3. BONUS: Complete step two using a template literal instead of concatenation

## Exercise 3: 

1. Declare a variable named myStory using the `let` keyword, and assign a string with 3 sentences detailing:
    - An introduction using your `fullName` variable.
    - An introduction using your `city` variable.
    - An introduction using your favorite `passtime` variable.
2. Be sure to use variables as the above answers (declare and assign variables if you haven't already)
3. Print the result of `myStory` to the browser console

Ex: 
```
let myStory = `\Hello! My name is ${fullName}. I live in ${city}. I enjoy ${passtime} and coding!`;
```
